    "Welcome to the Aruba AI Workshop Hands on Lab Environment! The lab is hosted in AWS and runs on an opensource platform called [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/). This workshop is broken into seven lab activities designed to reinforce the basic machine learning (ML) concepts from today's lecture.  The lab activities move through progressively more advanced ML concepts. The final two activities bring us to a deep learning model that determines if an image is a switch or an access point!\n",
