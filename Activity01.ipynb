    "In this lab we'll use a very simple dataset to determine if an object is an Apple or Orange. This is a problem that sounds easy but could be impossible to solve without machine learning. The real world is messy and the rules we write using traditional coding methods would start to break.  For example, how would you handle black and white images of the fruit? Or how would you handle images without an apple or an orange?  Apples or Oranges is a classic \"hello world!\" machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm is the procedure to figure out the \"rules\" for us so we don't have to code rules by hand and to do that we create a classifier. The lab uses supervised learning or a trained model to predict an apple or orange. You will create and use a classifier that will find patterns in training data. Then, when faced with previously unseen data your classifier model will make predictions on the type of fruit. The inspiration for the labs in activity 01-05 is the YouTube video series ‚ÄúMachine Learning Recipes with Josh Gordon.‚Äù To learn more about this lab you can watch [Hello World!
