    "Good features are informative, independent, and simple. It is important to evaluate features that useful and to evaluate more than one feature. In this activity we will use dog height to make a prediction on the breed of dog (Labradors or Greyhound).  in this lab we will produce a histogram that we can use to make a visual determination if the feature was useful.  \n",

    "After loading the necessary Python modules, we create a \"toy example\" with a population of dogs. <br>\n",
    "Half of the dogs will be Greyhounds and the other half Labradors (labs).\n",

    "We'll then see the average height to 28 inches and 24 inches tall respectively.\n",

    "Then plot the number of dogs based on height.  Do you think in this example, height alone was a useful feature for the model to make an accurate prediction?\n",
